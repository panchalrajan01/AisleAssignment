# AisleAssignment

In this Project I made an App in Swift which uses an OPEN API for Login Authentication using Phone Number and OTP using POST and GET Request

- Some of the Features
  - User can only enter numbers in the number text field, and it can't be more than 10 digits
  - Country Code can be from 1-3 digit long
  - Give Proper Alert Message when required (Eg: Incorrect Phone Number, Server Error etc)
  - An Edit Button allow you to move back to main screen to edit wrong number
  - A Counter shows the time remaining to expire the OTP
